# Automated disaster detection of satellite images
<p>This is my master project applying deep learning model to the satellite images.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to detect the affected area by natural disasters by using the way of semantic segmentation and change detection method. The model of semantic segmentation in this project is the U-Net which has been widely used semantic segmentation network.</p>
